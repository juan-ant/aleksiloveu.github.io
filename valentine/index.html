            <p>
              I can still remember how you looked the night we first met, hearing your voice, talking to you was like a dream.
              Your eyes, your beautiful eyes captured my heart and soul, I could see how pretty you are through your pure eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyday is a special one because of us, <br />
              The distance doesn't matter,<br />
              The kilometers doesn't matter,<br />
              The language doesn't matter,<br />
              Anything matters when our feelings are stronger, stronger than anything in this world, in this galaxy,<br />
              We share the same sky,<br />
              We share the same moon, <br />
              We share our lifes now...<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              We happened in the right time, not sooner, not later, not when we expected but when we needed<br />
              And I'm so thankful for us, <br />
              Gracias gracias por todo amor, <br />
              From the moment it started and until the end of the days I'll stay and be with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              No words can express how much feeling I have for you,<br />
              In any other galaxy, in any other lifetime, I would still choose to be and fall in love with you,<br />
              Thanks thanks to whoever put you in my life, you gave a new meaning to my days and now I can not imagine a life without you,
            </p>
            <p>
              Muchas gracias Aleks,
            </p>
            <p>
              Te amo,<br />
              I love you,<br />
              Я люблю тебя,<br />
              <br />
              With all of my love,
              <br />
              You're my everything Sash.
