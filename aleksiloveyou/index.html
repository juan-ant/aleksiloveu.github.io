					<h1>October 2019.</h1>
					<p>Last year I got the chance to met you. <br/> When I heard that you were coming to Mexico I never imagined how important you would be in my life.</p>

					<h1>Happiness</h1>
					<p>You're the living prove that good persons still exist, <br />
					   You're so kind, and caring, and you care about things that really matter, <br>
					   You have this magic that no matter how tense or bad my mood is you totally switch it to complete happiness only by being there. 
					   <br />
					   I love how we lost the sense of time when we're talking, we both were afraid of getting short of conversation topics.
					   <br />

					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
					We don't need to speak the same language or to live under the same time zones to understand each other.
					   <br />
					   I love you.

					   <br /> <br />
					   But right now we're not afraid of anything, sometimes we don't need to speak to communicate and to express ourselves.
					<br />
					We're not afraid of the silence, cos sometimes we only need to look at each others and let our eyes enjoy.
					<br />
					<br />
					Every day you're showing me how lucky I am of having you,
					<br />
					So lucky of finding you, the luckiest of having you.
					<br />
					I can't wait to see you again, to have you in my arms, to play with your hair, <br> I just to be WITH Y O U.
					<br />
					<br />
					When I saw you for the first time, I already knew I had found someone wonderful, maravillosa, amazing, increíble, and every day since then, all I have wanted is to be with you Sasha.
